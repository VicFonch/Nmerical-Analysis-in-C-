# Nmerical Analysis in C++

Package to work with numerical methods in c++

Is a group of functions from the subject Numerical Methods of the master's degree in Computer Science (CIMAT)

I'ts divided into a 7 groups of function 

1- Matrix and vector operators

2- Matrix factorizations

3- Solutions of systems of linear equations

4- Interpolation

5- Numerical Integration

6- Numerical differentiation

7- This section is dedicated to the functions corresponding to the final project, a softmax regression with PCA
